    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe has fueled me through long run days, late night study sessions, weekend Forza marathons, and more. It is the epitome of a good cookie: enjoyable at any temperature, but best served just warm enough to let the chocolate become all gooey.</p>
    <p>Even now, my mom will send a batch across the country because it's the perfect taste of home when I need it.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 sticks of butter (softened)</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>5 cups of flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of baking soda</li>

        <li>1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 full bag of Guittard large chocolate chips</li>
        <li>About 1/2 - 1 cup of mini aemi-sweet chocolate chips (depending on how much you want</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>

        <li>Mix in eggs and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Mix in flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>

        <li>Bake at 350ºF.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Mom's Tips</h2>
    <p>There is no set baking time. You have to continually check to see how much you want them to bake.</p>
    <p>You will need to  "pat them down" with a spatula a couple of times as they start to rise.</p>
    <p>Depending on the oven and elevation, you may need to bake at 325ºF, 350ºF, or even 400ºF.</p>
