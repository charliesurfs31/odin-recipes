    <h1>Chicken Pot Pie</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This was without a doubt my favorite dish growing up. It was a special occassion whenever my mom made it, especially since it took an entire day of planning and prep to get it right.</p>
    <p>The thing that really makes this recipe special are the changes my mom made to the original recipe. This includes using rotisserie chicken for more flavor, subbing the mushrooms for carrots and green onions, cooking the veggies in chicken broth instead of white wine and doubling the amount of crust and sauce. Also half a stick of butter instead of 1 tablespoon. The recipe on this website is written to reflect the changes, not the original recipe.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Pastry</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>2/3 cup chilled butter, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons ice water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups cubed cooked chicken</li>
        <li>1/2 stick butter</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh carrots and green onions</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups chicken broth (organic if you can)</li>
        <li>3 cups whipping cream (<em>not</em> half-and-half)</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Glaze</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To prepare pastry, in a medium bowl, mix together flour and salt. Using a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut butter into flour until course crumbs form.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, beat together egg and water. Add to the flour mixture; mix lightly until a soft dough forms. Shape into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and chill in the refigerator for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>To prepare the filling, place chicken in a 2-quart casserole.</li>
        <li>In large skillet, melt butter over low heat. Add carrots and green onions; increase the heat to medium-high; and sauté until browned and the liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken broth; cook for 2 minutes. Add veggie mixture to chicken. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, whisk together cream, flour, paprika, salt, and pepper, over low heat; cook until thickened, about 5 minutes. Whisk in broth. Pour sauce over chicken mixture.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400º F.</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the pastry to fit the top of the casserole. Place on top of pie; trim and seal the edges.</li>
        <li>Roll out trimmings. Cut out leaves and flowers (if desired. We do not do this). Brush pastry with glaze; add the decorations; brush again with glaze.</li>
        <li>Bake until filling is bubbly and crust is browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Mom's Tips</h2>
    <p>Pay attention to using ice water for the pastry. (I just put ice in a cup of water and spoon it from the top).</p>
    <p>Also make sure to use the glaze on the crust (lightly beaten egg). Otherwise the crust will burn. I just use a spoon and spread a little bit at a time around until everything is covered. If you have a pastry brush, that works best.</p>
